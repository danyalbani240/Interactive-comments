# My Motivation

# Topic
This Project is About Comments Section Of a Website.
The Project Idea And pictures was from frontendmentor.com and I dd from there.

# What Did I learned? 
Well  i Actually Learned that some times like before this project I should really code with simple vanilla and no framework, so i could keep the javascript and the deep learning in mind.
after this project i think i should look at the javascript.dev again.
And I learned how to write and run e2e tests
